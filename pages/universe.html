    <h1> Universe </h1>
  <p>
      The word "Universo" (Universe in English) derives from the Latin word "universum." The Latin word was used by Cicero and subsequently by other authors with the same meaning that it is currently employed. The Latin word is derived from the poetic contraction "unvorsum" - first used by Lucretius in Book IV of his "On the Nature of Things" - which connects "un" and "uni" (one) with "vorsum" and "versum" (meaning "something turned, rolled, or changed").
